# SONG-GENRE-classification

This project focuses on classifying songs into various genres using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts the genre of a song based on its audio features.

Key Features:
Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing songs with various audio features such as tempo, key, loudness, and more.
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.

Modeling: Several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, are trained and evaluated to determine the best-performing model.
Evaluation: The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to ensure the effectiveness of genre classification.
Tools & Libraries: The project is implemented using Python, with libraries such as scikit-learn for modeling and pandas for data manipulation.

Results:
The final model achieved an accuracy of 94% on the test set, demonstrating the capability of machine learning techniques in classifying song genres based on audio features.

Future Work:
Potential improvements include experimenting with deep learning models, expanding the dataset, and incorporating additional features such as lyrics and metadata for more accurate predictions.
